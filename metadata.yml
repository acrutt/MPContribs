description: "Since its start in 2011, Materials Project (MP, https://materialsproject.org/)\
  \ has grown into a world-wide resource for a materials sciences community of more\
  \ than 27,000 users who rely on the portal as a trusted source to accelerate their\
  \ research. As a result, they wish to help with MP's efforts by contributing back,\
  \ but also ask for support in sharing their experimental and computational datasets\
  \ alongside MP's curated results. This provides the opportunity for researchers\
  \ in both domains to validate calculations or measurements almost instantaneously\
  \ and use the disseminated data for integrated materials studies.\n\nWith the public\
  \ announcement of our general contribution framework, MPContribs, we present a sustainable\
  \ solution for well-curated data management, organization and dissemination in the\
  \ context of MP. The framework serves the purpose of collectively maintaining contributions\
  \ to local and MP community databases as annotations to existing MP materials. It\
  \ subsequently disseminates them through a generic interactive gateway powered by\
  \ Jupyter notebooks or through custom project web apps enabled by the webtzite app\
  \ kit."
