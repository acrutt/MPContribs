description:
Comparison of exfoliation energies Eₓ between JARVIS-DFT (NIST) and NU Singapore.
(JARVIS-DFT@NIST) density functional theory based database which consists of thousands
of VASP calculations (vdW-DF-optB88 functional). JARVIS-DFT includes data for more than
25000 bulk and 600 monolayer materials for properties such as energetics, diffraction
pattern, radial distribution function, band-structure, density of states, carrier
effective mass, temperature and carrier concentration dependent thermoelectric
properties, elastic constants and gamma-point phonons. (NUS-2D) 2,000 layered materials
were discovered by applying simple rules based on inter-atomic plane spacing and bonded
clusters of atoms in the structures, similar to what Hennig’s group has done. He then
calculated exfoliation energy of these materials to identify possible layered structures
that can be experimentally exfoliated into 2D materials. He has almost completed
high-throughput calculations on the properties of these 2D materials.
