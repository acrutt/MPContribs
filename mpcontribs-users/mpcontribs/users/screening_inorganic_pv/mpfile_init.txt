title: Screening Inorganic PV
authors: D. Fabini, M. Koerner, R. Seshadri
description:
Approximately 33,000 valence-precise, ordered inorganic compounds tabulated in
the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database have been screened for their potential
as photovoltaic (PV) absorbers. This has been accomplished through the use of
proxies for charge carrier mobilities and optical absorption properties from
electronic structure calculations, in addition to constraints on thermodynamic
stability. Preliminary screening of computed properties tabulated in the
Materials Project Database, with subsequent high(er)-fidelity electronic
structure calculations of optical properties and band gap corrections, indicates
~200 known compounds on or near the convex hull which exhibit spectroscopic
limited maximum efficiency (SLME) in excess of 25% for a 500 nm thin film, in
addition to possessing low effective masses for both electrons and holes. Among
the predicted high performers are nearly all the known commercial inorganic
thin film PV materials and several previously unexplored candidates. The new
candidates are drawn from a diverse set of chemical and structural families,
including many chalcogenides and pnictides as well as antiperovskites,
skutterudites, and semiconducting intermetallics. Carrier effective masses,
SLME, corrected band gaps, and other relevant information for ~800 compounds are
made available for further analyses via the Materials Project MPContribs
Framework.
