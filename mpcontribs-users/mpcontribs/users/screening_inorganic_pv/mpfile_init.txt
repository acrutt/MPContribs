title: Screening Inorganic PV
authors: D. Fabini, M. Koerner, R. Seshadri
description:
We have screened ~33,000 non-magnetic insulators/semiconductors for which there was a
computed bandstructure in the Materials Project for potential use as photovoltaic
absorbers. Like many studies, we employ a "funnel" approach of increasingly stringent
screening criteria that require increasingly expensive calculations. Below a summary of
high-level parameters extracted from these data, all for ~800 compounds. Ultimately, the
data we plan to share here are absorption coefficients (or full dielectric tensors),
electronic densities-of-states (higher fidelity than the ones currently in the MP
database), "corrected" bandgaps based on the method of Chan and Ceder (PRL 105, 196403).
