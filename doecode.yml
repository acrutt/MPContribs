  Since its start in 2011, Materials Project (MP,
  https://materialsproject.org/) has grown into a world-wide resource for a
  materials sciences community of more than 27,000 users who rely on the portal
  as a trusted source to accelerate their research. As a result, they wish to
  help with MP's efforts by contributing back, but also ask for support in
  sharing their experimental and computational datasets alongside MP's curated
  results. This provides the opportunity for researchers in both domains to
  validate calculations or measurements almost instantaneously and use the
  disseminated data for integrated materials studies.

  With the public announcement of our general contribution framework,
  MPContribs, we present a sustainable solution for well-curated data
  management, organization and dissemination in the context of MP. The
  framework serves the purpose of collectively maintaining contributions to
  local and MP community databases as annotations to existing MP materials. It
  subsequently disseminates them through a generic interactive gateway powered
  by Jupyter notebooks or through custom project web apps enabled by the
  webtzite app kit.
