title: Defect Physics of Air-Stable BiOI

description:
Strongly Enhanced Photovoltaic Performance and Defect Physics of Air-Stable Bismuth
Oxyiodide (BiOI). Bismuth-based compounds have recently gained increasing attention as
potentially non-toxic and defect-tolerant solar absorbers. However, many of the new
materials recently investigated show limited photovoltaic performance. Herein, we explore
in detail one such compound through theory and experiment: bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI). We
grow BiOI thin films by chemical vapor transport and find them to maintain the same
tetragonal phase in ambient air for at least 197 days. Our computations suggest BiOI to be
tolerant to antisite and vacancy defects. We demonstrate an all-inorganic solar cell
(ITO|NiOx|BiOI|ZnO|Al) with negligible hysteresis and up to 80% external quantum
efficiency under select monochromatic excitation. The short-circuit current densities and
power conversion efficiencies under AM 1.5G illumination are nearly double those of
previously-reported BiOI solar cells, as well as other bismuth halide and chalcohalide
photovoltaics recently explored by many groups. Through a detailed loss analysis using
optical characterization, photoemission spectroscopy and device modeling, we provide
direction for future improvements in efficiency. Our work demonstrates that BiOI,
previously considered to be a poor photocatalyst, is promising for photovoltaics.
