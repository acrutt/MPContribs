   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Webtzite
====================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

Webtzite is a `Django`_ app containing the core functionality of the `Materials
Project (MP)`_ web site. It enables the development of pluggable web apps
contributed by MP users. To develop an "MP-ready" app, you start a new Django
project, add ``webtzite`` as as app in the project, develop your app, and export
your app for release.

More documentation / a tutorial will be added as webtzite becomes more stable
after a couple rounds of dogfooding by MP staff in developing core apps.
