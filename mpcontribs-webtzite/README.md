# Webtzite
Webtzite is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) app containing the core functionality of MP's web site. It enables the development of pluggable web apps contributed by MP users. To develop an "MP-ready" app, you start a new Django project, add `webtzite` as as app in the project, develop your app, and export your app for release.

More documentation / a tutorial will be added as webtzite becomes more stable after a couple rounds of dogfooding by MP staff in developing core apps.
