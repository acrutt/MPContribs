>>>> general
# - use colon as separator for 'general' and 'plots' (sub-)sections
# - simple list of key-value pairs (all section but 'data' currently interpreted this way)
# - key serves as index -> needs to be unique
# - separate header entry in general section is not necessary. Pandas already
#   provides that since it is part of the data (user just "labels" the data)

acknowledgment: This dataset is the result of DOE grant 12345, NSF grant 12345, and the contributed efforts of many researchers. # line-wrapping?
thanks: my wife, Donald Duck, and Tom & Jerry
>>>> plots
# 'plots' subsection:
# - specify plots and according options
# - supports columns to be plotted referred to by header name
# - key-value pairs in this section are passed through to df.plot() (not tested)
# - optional since default plot generated during import
>>>>> special plot # plot title (can all be changed later)
x: beta #  no y-axis key -> overlay all y_i vs x in plot
>>>> data
# - 'data' sections are parsed with comma or tab as delimiter (dep. on file ending)
# - always require header row in data section
