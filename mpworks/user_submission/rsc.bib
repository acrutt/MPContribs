abstract  ="A random assembly of nanoscale electrically conducting wires{,} a so called a nanonet{,} has a variety of interesting properties{,} which has been exploited for multiple applications. These nanowire networks can also be regarded as a {"}scaffold{"} onto which molecules and nanoscale objects can be attached for well defined functionalities. This review summarizes the strategies of the attachments onto the scaffold{,} the investigation of the interface between the scaffold and the functional species together with the applications in the areas of renewable energy{,} opto-electronics{,} catalysis and biotechnology. The initial work on this novel materials platform will likely followed up by development efforts so that the fundamental value propositions associated with the scaffold can be fully exploited. Initial work towards this goal is gradually emerging."}

abstract  ="For applications of two-dimensional graphene{,} commercially viable sources are necessary. Exfoliation from bulk{,} stacked graphite is the most economical way to achieve large quantities of single layer graphene. A number of methods have been developed to achieve exfoliation of graphite{,} each with advantages and disadvantages. In this review{,} we describe current exfoliation methods and techniques used to produce single layer materials from graphite precursors."}
