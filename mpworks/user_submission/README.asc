user-contributed data submissions
---------------------------------

objective
~~~~~~~~~

The objective of the `user_submission_test.py` script is to develop a test
scenario for the submission of a multitude of possible user data formats and
their resulting JSON representation using http://pandas.pydata.org['Pandas'].
'Pandas' already handles a variety of different data table formats with index
columns and header rows, and their translation into the according python
objects. The respective common language is well established and allows for the
convenient
http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/io.html#csv-text-files[import of data
from csv] and other sources via a few options as well as the definition of a
set of
http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/io.html#writing-json[orientations] to
translate data objects to JSON.
http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html[Default
plotting] of the data objects with sensible options are also provided. Basicly,
'Pandas' represents simple one-column, possibly indexed data tables via
`Series` and all else (i.e. even multi-indexed data) via `DataFrame` objects.
This considerably facilitates the programmatic submission of data using the
Materials Project's REST API for user and developer. The approach of using
'Pandas' for MP user data submissions would not only guarantee a common
language with already plenty of existing documentation but would also leave the
specific data table formats under the user's control.

test cases
~~~~~~~~~~

`input.csv` is a csv-formatted file with a collection of possible user data
formats separated in sections by `#>>>`. The specific separator is not yet
agreed upon, but only used here for simplicity.  Each of the sections is
separately read into 'Pandas' objects using `read_csv()` with sensible options.
Currently, the file contains the following sections.

[options="compact"]
- a general section with properties, settings and defaults. This would be a
  list of 1-1-mappings imported as an indexed `Series` object. The MP might
  require certain unique row names in this section (mp-id, xtal-namem,
  authors etc.). Authors would be listed using their usernames and
  references in general using a unique bibtex-key. The respective bibtex-file
  is imported separately and bibtex-keys resolved dynamically. All following
  data sections can also be annotated to the user's liking with bibtex-keys for
  references and usernames for authors.
- a section with a simple list of annotated numbers including units. The number
  can have multiple columns to provide info on the respective conditions under
  which the number was generated. In general for all sections, the first column
  does not need to be unique.
- The other two sections are examples for the submission of an elastic tensor
  and frequency-dependent dielectric constants (see below).

Running `user_submission_test.py` pretty-prints the imported data using
'Pandas' defaults and outputs a JSON representation of how the data would be
saved in MP's database internally (-> `output.json`).
