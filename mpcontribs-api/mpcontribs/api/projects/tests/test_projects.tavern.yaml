              description: >-
                  Bandgaps calculated using GLLB-SC potential by Gritsenko, van Leeuwen, van Lenthe, and Baerends
                  (GLLB), adapted by Kuisma et al to account for solids (-SC). The Kohn-Sham gap (ΔE-KS) most basically
                  refers to the energy difference between the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence
                  band. The Quasi-Particle gap (ΔE-QP) takes into account the derivative discontinuity (C) of the
                  chemical potential and gives the bandgap as the difference between ionization potential and electron
                  affinity.

              description: >-
                  Strongly Enhanced Photovoltaic Performance and Defect Physics of Air-Stable Bismuth Oxyiodide (BiOI).
                  Bismuth-based compounds have recently gained increasing attention as potentially non-toxic and
                  defect-tolerant solar absorbers. However, many of the new materials recently investigated show limited
                  photovoltaic performance. Herein, we explore in detail one such compound through theory and
                  experiment, namely bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI). We grow BiOI thin films by chemical vapor transport and
                  find them to maintain the same tetragonal phase in ambient air for at least 197 days. Our computations
                  suggest BiOI to be tolerant to antisite and vacancy defects. We demonstrate an all-inorganic solar
                  cell (ITO|NiOx|BiOI|ZnO|Al) with negligible hysteresis and up to 80% external quantum efficiency under
                  select monochromatic excitation. The short-circuit current densities and power conversion efficiencies
                  under AM 1.5G illumination are nearly double those of previously-reported BiOI solar cells, as well as
                  other bismuth halide and chalcohalide photovoltaics recently explored by many groups. Through a
                  detailed loss analysis using optical characterization, photoemission spectroscopy and device modeling,
                  we provide direction for future improvements in efficiency. Our work demonstrates that BiOI,
                  previously considered to be a poor photocatalyst, is promising for photovoltaics.
