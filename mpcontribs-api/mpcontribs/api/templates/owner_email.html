Please visit {{host}}/#work to get started with adding data to your (private) project. Send
a list of MPContribs user e-mails to {{admin_email}} if you'd like to add collaborators
who can help maintain the data in your project.

Your project has been deleted. There are two reasons why this can happen:

- You (or admins in coordination with you) have deliberately deleted a project you owned
  that was previously approved.  No further action is required if this was intentional.
- You applied for a new project on MPContribs but the request was denied. There are a
  myriad of possibilities for reasons why we reached this decision and you should soon
  receive a follow-up email from an admin. We might request more information, ask you to
  resubmit at a later point due to workload, or explain why MPContribs might not be the
  right fit for your data. If you don't hear from us within a day or so, feel free to send
  an email to {{admin_email}}. Thanks!
