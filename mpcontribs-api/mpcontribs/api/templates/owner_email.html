<p>Please launch <a href="#TODO">this notebook</a> to start adding data to your (private) project.
<a href="mailto:{{admin_email}}">Send us</a> a list of MPContribs user e-mails if you'd like to add collaborators who
can help maintain the data in your project.</p>
{% else %}
<p>Your project has been deleted. There are two reasons why this can happen:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You (or admins in coordination with you) have deliberately deleted a project you owned that was previously
        approved. No further action is required if this was intentional.
    </li>
    <li>
        You applied for a new project on MPContribs but the request was denied. There are myriad possibilities for
        reasons why we reached this decision and you should soon receive a follow-up email from an admin. We might
        request more information, ask you to resubmit at a later point due to workload, or explain why MPContribs might
        not be the right fit for your data. If you don't hear from us within a day or so, feel free to
        <a href="mailto:{{admin_email}}">reach out</a> to us. Thanks!
    </li>
</ul>
