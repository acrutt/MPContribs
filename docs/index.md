# Community Contributions to Materials Project

Since its start in 2011, [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org) (MP) has grown
into a world-wide resource for a materials sciences community of more than 75,000 users
who rely on the portal as a trusted source to accelerate their research. As a result, they
wish to help with MP's efforts by contributing back, but also ask for support in sharing
their experimental and computational datasets alongside MP's curated results. This
provides the opportunity for researchers in both domains to validate calculations or
measurements almost instantaneously and use the disseminated data for integrated materials
studies.

With the public announcement of our general contribution framework, MPContribs, we present
a sustainable solution for well-curated data management, organization and dissemination in
the context of MP. The framework serves the purpose of collectively maintaining
contributions to MP community databases as annotations to existing MP materials. It
subsequently disseminates them through MP's materials details pages as well as its
[portal](https://portal.mpcontribs.org) and [API](https://api.mpcontribs.org).
