# Community Contributions to Materials Project

![banner](MPContribsGithubSocial.png)

*MPContribs* is a platform that enables the materials science community to contribute
experimental and theoretical materials data to [Materials
Project](https://materialsproject.org) (MP) and use MP's infrastructure to expose their
research results to the public. Contributions to MP are collectively maintained as
annotations to existing MP materials. *MPContribs* disseminates them as preview cards on
MP's materials details pages, in form of domain-specific interactive landing pages on its
[portal](https://portal.mpcontribs.org), and programmatically through its
[API](https://api.mpcontribs.org).
