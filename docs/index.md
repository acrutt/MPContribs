# Community Contributions to Materials Project

The *MPContribs* platform enables the materials science community to contribute
experimental and theoretical materials data to [Materials
Project](https://materialsproject.org) (MP) and use MP's infrastructure to expose their
research results to the public. *MPContribs* aims to be a sustainable solution for
well-curated data management, organization and dissemination in the context of MP.  It
collectively maintains contributions to MP as annotations to existing MP materials. It
subsequently disseminates them as preview cards on MP's materials details pages, in form
of domain-specific interactive landing pages on its
[portal](/portal), and programmatically through its [API](/api).
