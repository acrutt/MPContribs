The [Cards Explorer](https://portal.mpcontribs.org/explorer/) allows search and preview of
contributions across all materials and projects. When projects and/or material identifiers
are requested, a preview card is generated and displayed for a couple of representative
contributions. The tile of the card links to the project's landing page, and the *Details*
button opens the corresponding [detail page](/portal/detail_pages).
