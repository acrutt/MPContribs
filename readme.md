This repository collects the modules used by contributors to enable their data
submissions via MP's contribution framework
[MPContribs](https://github.com/materialsproject/MPContribs). Responsibility
and maintenance of the code here lies with the user / partner project.

Contribution Cards use the keys `title`, `description`, `authors`, `urls` to
generate their contents.
